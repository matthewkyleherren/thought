Video sells. Video works. Those are the facts, marketers. If you want to stay on top of the social media marketing game, you’ve got to have a strong video element. 81% of the business uses video and a full 97% believe that video helped increase user awareness and understanding of their product or service.</p><p class="">People are more interested and willing to spend their time watching a quick, catchy, odd video than they are in reading paragraphs of copy. No matter how well it’s written, it’s easier for the average person to watch a video, even peripherally, than sit and read copy.</p><p class="">However, because video is becoming so much more central to the marketing bag of tricks, you’re going to want to create videos that get you seen above the rest of the iPhone users in the pack. You want to be slick without looking slick; you want to have better control over your video and produce the types of video that will catch the eye and get you talked about in the social media circles. This doesn’t mean you’ll need to hire famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, it just means the tools you employ need to suit your needs and style well.</p><p class="">What this means is, you’ll want to have the proper social media video tools for shooting, editing, cutting, publishing, and monitoring trends for your video content on any social media site. In this article, we will examine the types of tools you’ll need to kick out some great video content.</p><p class="">We will look at:</p><ul class="lst"><li>Tools to monitor social media trends</li><li>Tools to create visuals</li><li>Tools to create and edit videos</li><li>Tools to host your videos</li><li>Tools to schedule your social media posts</li></ul><p class="">So, let’s jump in and get your video social media marketing tool kit up to date.</p><h2 class="">Monitor Social Media Trends</h2><figure class="bp__figure__img"><img width="1200" height="800" src="../../../images.prismic.io/thoughtlab2021/fdc0d2a4-8572-4239-a4f1-5a867868b2ee_social%2bmedia71fb.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="a steel wall with graffiti reading all we need is more likes" class="full-width"></figure><p class="">Let’s start by looking at some tools that will help you with your video marketing strategy.</p><p class=""><strong>BuzzSumo</strong></p><p class="">When it comes to creating videos, you’ll want a content research and discovery tool that helps you identify what’s trending and popular with audiences on social media. That’s when you should look at<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link" href="https://https://buzzsumo.com/"> BuzzSumo.</a></p><p class="">Simply put, you type in a keyword, and the software pulls out trends around that word. This allows you some insight into which trends are popular to create some solid, audience-relevant video content.</p><p class=""><strong>Mention</strong></p><p class="">Much like BuzzSumo, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link" href="https://https://mention.com/en/">Mention </a>is a monitoring tool primarily used for social media. You can use it to track keywords, but the difference here is, you can set up alerts when someone mentions your brand and/or predefined related keywords. This allows you to jump on some relatable video content quickly and precisely.</p><h2 class="">Visual Creation</h2><p class="">More than just video, you’ll want some tools that give you more possibilities.

You’re going to generate some seriously professional-looking content with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link" href="https://https://www.apple.com/imovie/">iMovie.</a> Like most Apple products, the catch with iMovie is that you can use it easily right away. If you want to know the full potential and how that can impact your social media campaign, take the time to really understand it before you edit your first video. With Apple products, the more you know, the better you can create.</p><p class=""><strong>Moovly</strong></p><p class="">Create social media videos to your heart’s content and more. With a bag of customizable templates, you’ll be creating promotional videos, explanatory videos, tutorials, training videos, and vampire flicks.</p><p class="">But wait, there’s more to it. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link" href="https://https://www.moovly.com/">Moovly </a>also has features like subtitles, the ability to remove color, custom colors and fonts, white labeling, and text-to-speech capabilities.

Like we said, easy.</p><p class=""><strong>Renderforest</strong></p><p class="">This is an animated video creator’s paradise. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link" href="https://https://www.renderforest.com/">Renderforest</a> makes animation so easy that it actually becomes fun.

Now you need a place to upload them, get them seen by the public, get a following, and create a buzz. Once you’ve taken the time and effort to create a great video, you need to make sure as many people see it as possible.</p><p class=""><strong>YouTube</strong></p><p class="">This is video hosting ubiquity.
