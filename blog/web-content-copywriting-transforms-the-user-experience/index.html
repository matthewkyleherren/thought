It is the story of the company, product, service, and all facets thereof. The balance is a fine line between images, animation, and the written word. If the balance falls out of whack, the entire feel of the website and the story told can fall apart.</p><p class="">The thing to keep in mind is that not just one type of person will visit your site. Some stats and metrics claim people want to see video or animation. Then again, some stats say the written word is what keeps people on the page. The reality is, you need a strong balance of all the elements to have a better chance at capturing a broad audience and keeping them on the page long enough to convert.</p><p class="">Web content copywriting, when done well, weaves a story but does not overshadow the other elements. Good copy works in sympathy with video, photos, and animation, supporting the narrative. Copy can sometimes lead the viewer to the next page and fill in bits of information that require more elucidation in supplement of video or imagery.</p><p class="">A website that converts is a website that has achieved and maintained a good balance. Part of that balance is strong web content copywriting. Armed with solid copy, you can enhance the user’s experience throughout your website.</p><p class=""><strong>In this article, we will discuss:</strong></p><ul class="lst"><li>What a Web Content Copywriter Does</li><li>How Web Content Copywriting Differs From The Traditional Form</li><li>How The User Experience Is Transformed By Web Content Copywriting</li><li>Getting Web Content Copywriting Help</li></ul><p class="">Let’s dive in!</p><h2 class="">What Does a Web Content Copywriter Do?</h2><figure class="bp__figure__img"><img width="1200" height="1800" src="../../../images.prismic.io/thoughtlab2021/38f6c034-784d-4731-ac63-a3560ee0721e_wrietr%2bdoes71fb.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="an encourgaing note for writers; write without fear, edit without mercy" class="full-width"></figure><p class="">At the very core of it, a website content copywriter tells a story. The story is about the company, person, or product for whom the copywriter has been engaged to write. Unlike regular storytelling, this type of storytelling is a bit less linear, and the copywriter is creating a story that will end with an action being taken. A reader of a story simply absorbs and enjoys, a reader of the story of the website, if the writer does their part of the creation of the site well, will then take action; click, read more, buy a product, sign up for a service, and such.</p><p class=""><strong>A team member</strong></p><p class="">A website content copywriter is tasked with setting the tone, voice, and style of the written parts of the site. They will work in conjunction with a designer to make the copy fit and look suitable with the design. Copy on a website must work with an overall design. If the space the designer has given the copywriter to fill is only so big, then the writer must keep their copy to fit in line with that space.</p><p class="">However, if the relationship between designer and copywriter is solid and collaborative, the copywriter can dictate some changes in space so that their part of the story can be told more clearly. One of the most important things to remember is that a copywriter’s work is only one bar of the website spectrum. It is not more or less critical; it is as vital as the design. Keeping this idea in mind will make it easier for the website copywriter to function well within the creative team.</p><p class=""><strong>A consistent voice</strong></p><p class="">The copywriter on a website writes as a guide, leading the reader from page to page with short bits of copy that will activate the user to move to the next page, image, or product. All while keeping a through-line of the company’s voice, values, mission, and their why.</p><p class="">A website content copywriter will often create a tone guide before they start the copy work so that the client can get a feeling for how the copywriter is approaching the work and making sure both parties are aligned with purpose, voice, and goals. Once that is established, the copywriter adheres to the guidelines, so there is consistency in copy, like the consistency in visual design.</p><p class="">If the tone of voice or the writing style changes from page to page, it sends an inconsistent and confusing message to the user and will destroy the user’s experience when coming to the site.</p><p class="">Again, the website content copywriter is telling a story. Imagine reading a book by Melville, and in chapter three, the tone and style change to that of Jane Austin. Inconsistent, confusing, and the reader loses trust.</p><p class="">If the copywriter loses the user’s trust, they won’t click, scroll, read more or sign up. Then the purpose of the site is damaged.</p><h2 class="">How is Web Content Copywriting Different from Traditional Copywriting?</h2><figure class="bp__figure__img"><img width="1200" height="900" src="../../../images.prismic.io/thoughtlab2021/7cdeebe2-7840-4fdd-a6cb-1e65ab59a892_traditional%2bwriter71fb.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="a lap top, blank book, pen and a cup of tea" class="full-width"></figure><p class="">Copywriting and content writing comes in a variety of forms. They have different purposes within their respective categories, and each iteration requires a unique focus and touch.</p><p class="">In simplest terms, a content writer’s job is to educate and inform, whereas the main focus of copywriting is to persuade. However, those definitions just brush the surface. For a more in-depth view of content versus copy, take a look at this article and get deep.</p><p class="">Website content copywriting combines the skills and purposes of straight content with the persuasive abilities of copywriting and adds to a few more elements.</p><p class=""><strong>The additions</strong></p><p class="">Much like straight copywriting, website content copywriting requires an element of persuasion. The user has come to the page, so some of the heavy lifting has been done; however, the rest of the job is just starting.</p><p class="">They have landed on the page now; you’ve got to persuade them to stay. Go to the next page. Click the CTAs, view the product or services page, and ultimately, get them to sign up for the mailer, newsletter, free gift (which is redundant, just saying), or make a purchase. Getting them to the page is straightforward copywriting; keeping them there and getting them to go deeper is the copywriting element required for website copywriting.</p><p class="">Now there’s content writing, which is usually used to inform or entertain. Here is where you need the consistency of voice. If you’re writing copy for a financial guide website, suddenly throwing in slang or poetry is going to be jarring, and you’ll see the user bounce.</p><p class="">Now you have to decide if the primary goal is to entertain and keep them on the page, with a solid information infrastructure, or the opposite? Inform with some subtle entertainment thrown in. Fail to understand the proper nuance and once again, your user will bounce.</p><p class=""><strong>That’s entertainment?</strong></p><p class="">A website content copywriter must understand that their personal idea of humor or entertainment may not fit with the client or the audience they seek to connect with.</p><p class="">The copywriter is always working in the service of the client, the website, the voice, and the messaging style that works best for the site.</p><p class=""><strong>SEO rules</strong></p><p class="">A website content copywriter will naturally optimize their content for SEO. And, if it’s not a natural instinct, it needs to be learned.</p><p class="">SEO is vital for getting the website to rank high on a Google search. However, there are rules, and just filling your content blocks with keywords and phrases will get you flagged, and then, you’re sent to Google jail where everyone can open you up and rummage around inside you freely.</p><p class="">Good SEO writing is good writing. Quality writing that still tells a story adheres to a narrative, gives information, and entertains while seamlessly weaving the optimizing phrases and words into the copy. It is a trap to try to write for SEO. Ultimately the audience you’re writing for is a bunch of human-type people, not an algorithm.</p><p class=""><strong>The beauty of the blog</strong></p><p class="">A website content copywriter may be called upon to write blogs for clients, or, if they are part of a marketing agency, they may write blogs for the agency’s website. This just got kinda meta.</p><p class="">For a web content copywriter, a blog is like a farmer’s market. There is much on offer and much that can be achieved.</p><p class="">A well-crafted blog post can both entertain and provide fresh new copy with a new crop of keywords so Google will recognize the site as active and informative. This helps with the site’s overall ranking.</p><p class="">A blog can also make a website stand out as an “expert” on specific subjects. This expertise will help build an audience and foster relationships with potential and current users.</p><p class="">The blog also gives you a chance to link to other authorities, other sites and build connections with businesses. The sharing of a blog is something that Google finds yummy. The more shares, the better your ranking.</p><h2 class="">How Web Content Copywriting Transforms the User Experience</h2><figure class="bp__figure__img"><img width="1200" height="713" src="../../../images.prismic.io/thoughtlab2021/7f948f7e-bf81-426f-b73d-4062273183ae_transform71fb.jpg?auto=compress,format" alt="a old builidng transformed by a mural over it" class="full-width"></figure><p class="">The simple fact is, when the web content copy is well written, with clear goals, active words, and nicely demarcated calls to action, then reading it can be fun.</p><p class="">When the point is clear, and the product descriptions are imagery-rich, this is fun. When the story of the company on the about page or this is us page is detailed and has a strong narrative, it is fun.</p><p class="">When the copy helps the user navigate the site to get exactly what they want, and then they like it so much, they spend time scrolling through; this is fun.</p><p class="">Good web content copywriting can inform, ease, direct, activate but, above all, it can make the user’s experience on your site fun!</p><p class=""><strong>Quick tips</strong></p><p class="">If you’re new to the game or have been in it for a while and feel stale, here are some quick tips to help jump-start your website content copywriting. These are just suggestions and, as with any creative endeavor, use what works for you and let the rest go. When it comes to creativity, there are no hard and fast rules.</p><p class=""><strong>Writing is active.</strong></p><p class="">Use active verbs. Get your audience to do, learn, try, taste, etc. Drive them actively toward the goal.</p><p class=""><strong>5 Ws one H.</strong></p><p class="">Anyone can find anything on the internet so, get your facts straight. Get all the details and make sure they are correct.</p><p class=""><strong>Headlines.</strong></p><p class="">Imagine the classic newsboy standing in Times Square holding up a newspaper and barking the headline. That kind of energy and attention-grabbing is what you’ll want in your written headlines.</p><p class=""><strong>Get there fast.</strong></p><p class="">Don’t fall in love with your own words. Get to your points quickly and clearly, and then, once you have established, you can throw in the flourishes and the jokes.</p><h2 class="">Web Content Copywriting by ThoughtLab</h2><p class="">There’s a lot to cover and think about.
